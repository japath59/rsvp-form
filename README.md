# rsvp-form


Full Stack Project I have been on and off on but decided to finish.

## Front End:

Next.js 14 (App Router) – for full-stack React framework and API routes

React (with Hooks) – for managing state (useState) and form logic

Tailwind CSS – utility-first CSS framework for styling

Custom CSS (globals.css) – for form layout and background styling

HTML5 – for form structure and semantic markup



## Backend (within Next.js):

Next.js API Routes – handling POST requests from the RSVP form (/api/rsvp)

Google Sheets API (via Google Cloud Service Account) – to store submitted RSVP data securely

Environment Variables (.env.local) – to keep Google credentials private

I originally linked it through MongoDB but thought linking it to google sheets was more realistic


## Hosting & Deployment

Vercel – for hosting and automatic deployment from your GitHub repo

## Version Control & Security

Git + GitHub – for source control and collaboration

.gitignore + Environment Variables – to protect API keys and private files
